Welcome to Movie Moo, a webstie for people struggling to find a movie to watch to cure their boredom. This app was created following the Model View Template architecture, with a flask backend and HTML/CSS frontend.

When you first open the website, you will be greeted with a welcome page where the user can select to login to their account or register a new one

Next, you will be directed to a page where you fill out certain entries in a form that act as filters for the kind of movie you want to watch. These filters include genre, date released, and language.

When the form is submitted you will be returned a random movie that satisfies the requirements that you selected in the form.

You can learn more about the movie you were recommended by pressing the "Learn more about this movie" button.

If you would like to watch this movie later, you can press the "Add to wishlist" button. You will be redirected to your wishlist page which contains all the movies you have added to your wishlist. You can choose learn more about each movie from there or remove it from your wishlist.

If you have already watched this movie, you can press the "Mark as Watched" button. You will be redirected to your watched movies page which consists of the movies you have already watched. You can choose to delete the movie from the watched page or vote on whether you enjoyed the movie or not.

If you choose to vote, you will have another option which allows you to share your opinions about the movie on Twitter.

Lastly, on the left side of every page, you will see a set of navigative symbols. What follows is the key for each symbol:
1) The search symbol will redirect you to the search page
2) The cart symbol will redirect you to your wishlist
3) The castle symbol will reidrect you to the movies you have watched
4) The exit symbol will allow you to logout

That's it for this app! Hope you enjoy!
